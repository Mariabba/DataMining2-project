<p>""This is the first album I wish to be remembered by. Recorded through a bleak year of my life, 2006, Boss of Goth is an album of power-mourning, demon-fighting and vengeance-fucking. Trapped inside despair over the death of true love, childhood, and joy, I have always clung voraciously to a promise of a better tomorrow. I finished this album in March of 2007 and held on to it until now to make sure I would still love it enough to make 500 of them.<br /><br />Boss of Goth includes industrial punk and pop style songs with occasional fleeting dance beats and bursts of harsh noise. Vocals are the central focus, creating sweet pop ballads and lurking creep-stalker punk melt-downs. A variety of microphone processing accompanying sequencers, drum machines, and tons and tons of manipulated cassette tapes. Twisted collage journeys and quick punches to the throat. A fitting comparison perhaps: To Live and Shave in LA meets Nine Inch Nails, with the spirits of Edward Ka-Spel, Suckdog, and bedroom four track. Includes 6 songs that have appeared regularly in live performances. Oh yeah, and I play piano on the last track.<br /><br />Album includes two hidden bonus tracks. The first a live performance caught at the end of my ""temper tantrum approach"" to harsh noise performance. The second is Dragging an Ox Through Water (aka Brian Mumford) singing a cover of my song ""Save Life's Golden Receipt in Case Refund Needed."" Both were recorded at Someday Lounge by Ryan Olson.<br /><br />CD comes with a 12 page booklet with lyrics.

213,0,2008-11-26 01:53:47,2007-07-05 00:00:00,,1,86,"<p>""It took me exactly six months from the day of its release to begin writing about Au’s self-titled “debut” album. Despite the crippling procrastination that plagues most Tiny Mix Tapes reviewers (okay, just me, but I am not averse to dragging my superior wordsmiths into my wading pool of incompetence), I am genuinely surprised at my lack of motivation and overall laxness in penning this one. It’s not like the album hasn’t gaily danced its way into my pleasure center and taken up residence in my hypothalamus during the past few months or anything! <br />Au (“ay-yoo”) is primarily Luke Wyland, a musically promiscuous Portlander who in 2005 released peaofthesea under the simple handle “luc.” Some of Au will appeal tremendously to those longing for Sung Tongs-era Animal Collective. Opening track “Boute,” in particular, recalls that same exciting positive folk feel that Messrs. Tare and Bear practice when the mood strikes them. “Sum” is just as thrilling; after an intro of tinkles and strums, the song starts in earnest around 0:43 with a mix of banjo, Zoë Wright’s dreamy vocals, and then a full muddled arsenal of rattles and clangs as it quickly builds a sound drift of intoxicating proportions.</p>
<p>“Shelter” is a quiet dazzler that thrashes together two important sections of Wyland’s creative CV: his childhood classical piano education and his avant-garde work. It is a lovely piece of vocal-splicing and piano- and sleighbell-abetted drone that runs a course without any real end goal. In fact, it doesn’t really go anywhere at all, but it feels wonderful getting there. Elsewhere, without hinging on any major sensational events, Au reveals itself slowly, subtly, and satisfyingly. “Death,” which features vocal help from A Weather’s Sarah Winchester that actually sounds like creeping death, starts a dark troika from cleanup to sixth in Au’s batting order. After this bout of introspection comes the meditative exercise “Life” and “Ask the River,” closing the album with a discharge of freshly-plucked notes.</p>
<p>Maybe it is not entirely my fault that I sat on this album a little longer than I would have preferred. It would be easy to disregard this li’l slip of an album if it were not for the music it contains. With a non-descript, hand-drawn cover and very little fanfare trumpeted by my beloved Rolling Stone and Spin (joking), Au perhaps suffers from underexposure, which is a shame because it would take a malcontent of the highest order to find many faults with this superb example of modern songwriting. While comparisons can be made to other forward-thinking acts, Au genuinely feels like a blank slate record: it is devoid of many thoughts of the past, instead relying on painting little, unique pictures with sounds. It has the feel of a “graphic score” rather than an album. In musical notation, Au is all warm wingdings.</p>
<p>The whole album soundtracks a stimulating encounter between song and sound. At times haunting and morose, at other times uplifting, Au is a mixed bag with plenty of tasty tricks. Rather than patching things together like a weekend carpenter in a vain effort to make a million things “fit,” Wyland employs the skills of a seasoned curry cook, sprinkling in a measured variety of sonic concepts like garam masala into the finest of dishes. Wyland and his Au collaborators have produced an accomplished and commendable album.

<p>Blah Blah Blah started out during the late 70s punk explosion creating sounds that were deliberately anti-music, anti-cool and above all totally unique.  Improvising on electronic instruments they ventured where no-one else dared go.  Their credo never to repeat a single number (even live) meant that everything was recorded for posterity.  Each session unearthed enough golden nuggets to make the journey worth it.  These gathered nuggets were then released as albums. In the 80s they appeared at the 1st Leeds Futurama Festival and were briefly grouped with the Futurists, sharing live bills alongside fledgling electro-poppers Depeche Mode and chanteuse Marc Almond. The division of live audiences into Blah haters and Blah lovers, often caused near-riots. They eventually retired from the limelight following an attempted live arson attack on band members by a nice fellow in the audience at their thirteenth gig in Stevenage. If you mixed The Residents with the Bonzo Dog Doodah Band and Captain Beefheart you might end up with Blah Blah Blah – whimsical, weird and totally barmy.  The influence of nursery rhymes, sea-shanties, trash literature and TV, and instruments sounding like something that’s escaped from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.</p>",8,2008-11-26 01:55:23,20,84,,Colchester UK,,"Martin Croxford, Peter Wiggins, Vicky Jones, Ian Smith, Chris Andrews.",Blah Blah Blah,,"['blah blah blah', 'chris andrews']",http://sirhcswerdna.wix.com/chris-andrews#!blah-blah-blah/cbff,,training,large,256000,0,chris andrews,2008-11-26 01:52:35,2007-09-01 00:00:00,136,0,Rock,[89],"[89, 12, 25]",,159,en,Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England ,89,,1,,[],Splish spladdy

Immediate  ""what the hell do we need an overmodulated Canned Heat"" questions become  dispelled as you actually jump into the river and go with the flow of THE  RIFF. The hilarity of it all is punctuated by the arrival of the harmonica  player, which actually sounds like some kind of crazed electronics  blaring from a Masonna record or something; it eventually makes total  sense as does this whole EP. It rocks and bulldozes beyond belief, and  when song one is done, you get another almost like it. What more can a choogler  want?

It defies belief but I present it to you as truth in this condensed form. He is a being from another time and another place; a place not of this Earth but another world.In that world, Borful Tang was one of the legendary hill herders and a musician of great renown. Hill herding was a mysterious profession, the art known only to a few, passed down from master to apprentice. He shepherded the hills from one region to another across the vast plains of the world, communicating and moving them through sound.In his rambling home atop one of the larger hills, he crafted instruments that produced huge complex swathes of sound. Some of them resembled the giant horns used by the Tibetans in our world, while others were large, intricate wooden contraptions capable of playing repeated, interweaving patterns. Borful would send forth mighty volleys of drones and cascading notes, and the hills would lift slowly up with a great cracking of stone and earth. As a hill shuffled onward, another would come in and settle on the abandoned ground. In this slow, stately manner he roamed the plains with his flock.More socially minded than the traditional hill herder,  Borful would often look in on the towns and cities that existed on the edges of the great plains and listen to their different musics. As he absorbed the sounds from these disparate cultures, he became intrigued with the idea of performance and composition. He combined these new ideas and melodies with elements of his hill sound, creating a uniquely powerful music. He began performing this music and so his legend grew.However, there was great turmoil coming to the world. At the height of his fame, a group of lords in league with dark forces of great mystical power, splintered off from the democratic governing body and took control of that world in a violent coup. They opened a portal between their world and ours here on Earth. Undetected by the governing bodies of our planet, they used the Slave Birds to capture humans and bring them back through the portal to work in their immense ore mines. They grew rich and powerful, ruling their world with a ruthless single-minded quest for power.The lords knew the legend of the hill herders and that of Borful Tang. They wanted control of the ancient hills for themselves but Borful alone, resisted. With some renegade human slaves, he took the hills into battle against the lords, but their power was too great. He was forced to retreat, only to be caught by the Slave Birds and brought through the portal to Earth.Borful Tang remains here in exile, his life as a hill herder snatched away. He finds solace in his music. He cannot craft the instruments he once played with the available materials on our world. but he has learned how to utilize the technology of our time to at least continue his musical path.There is far more to this tale than can be explained in this brief text.

On an LP compiling two EPs <em>Hunt Like the Devil/Jamz</em> (<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/permanentwax"">Permanent Records</a>), shifting metrics of gunky synths, repetitive basslines and overall astral-gazing permeate these grooves in abundance. If Oneida were devoid of a bit of their precision and sprawled in a way to let figures tumble over into each other more often you might get an idea of what Cave were up to rhythmically, but it's when the guitars start to go into acid rampage mode is when I really get interested. Once they start cooking there's some comparisons to Comets on Fire, Titan, or the Heads, but in some ways it still resides  in some of the safer zones of a number of the Can-worship types who take it all a bit too literally. Which isn't to say it's a bad thing; there are plenty of surprises and sharp turns going on in the studio which make these two EPs diverse, I guess I'd like to hear the production a little rougher around the edges and let certain elements come unhinged a bit more, but again, pretty nice listening.

St-Onge's dark, minimal and lush double bass is a perfect compliment to Geller's unconventional and minimal song structures. The songs and sounds refract each element together like an interplay between cracked and broken mirrors. The lyrics to the songs, like the film, make explicit that the violence of political reality interweaves with emotional, personal and psychic life, demonstrating the total inseparability of the world and self and sexuality. Recommended for people who saturate and submerge themselves in their listening. (-via <a href=""http://www.ikuisuus.net/index1.htm"" target=""_blank"">Ikuisuus.net</a>)</p>",352,,[],12 December 2007,1,Live Performance,,,"Museum Fire, VHf","<p>I am a woman and I am a musician, and I am something distinctly separate, that is neither of those, but something combinatory of those two and many other aspects. I am not a &lsquo;womyn born womyn&rsquo; except in the imaginings brought by a set of purely social acts that are sometimes amidst the multiple nows becoming a body.<br /> Nor am I a musician who sings for the &lsquo;soul&rsquo; or some unspeakable emotion. I noise, in my quiet way, to speak the twisted and skewed, fully utterable at the moment we dare to say what has been feared or forbidden.<br /> As this neither woman nor musician, or both at once, I find my better self against fixity and commodity, loathing the marketing of the intimacy of personal space, a demand for the performer&rsquo;s sexuality or personality, the gaze that coats living, changing, morphing tissue and fluid with the suffocating synthetics of expectation, projection, and other desires that form the violent refuse disowned by the normal world. (Trauma is not for oggling.) <br /><br /> I cannot just yet call music &ldquo;work.&rdquo; For &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the corporate US is only ever mechanical reproduction. Only productivity is rewarded: (how many &ldquo;records have you sold?&rdquo;) When I view music as work, in this everywhere definition, it loses its intimacy, and becomes something empty and exhausting.<br /> Nor can I easily call music &ldquo;property.&rdquo; For property involves nervously guarding, and desiring isolation. I have never dreamed of a cash cow or a Mercedes. I do not wish to join the propertied class, so that someday I turn and look upon a bandmate as a &ldquo;marketable&rdquo; bringer of &lsquo;cool&rsquo; or &lsquo;cred.&rsquo; <br /><br /> Yet it is not adequate for music to be free of charge, or to self-sacrifice in the process.  <br /><br /> Why should this worker-of-a-different-kind barely live? In this era, the life-sacrifice of a cultural worker can only endorse the very structure of exploitation and de-humanization pushed into, forward, around and within the de-humanizing world of multinational capital. The capitalist accumulators have to starve musicians, writers and thinkers to survive, because if they did not, the entire fabric of culture would be different, less tolerant of US security and less afraid. To allow ourselves to be starved willingly, bolstered by the fantasy of the &lsquo;starving artist,&rsquo; is to collude with the plans of the agents of exploitation who right now stalk the globe with tanks and missiles. <br /><br />The anti-war demonstrators have broken a silence that has postured as US patriotism since September 11th. There are many silences to be broken. Silence breakers in the realm of the word, and in the structures of sound, are being starved, censored, and humiliated daily. Funding is steadily being cut off, intellectual projects are being gutted, major labels increasingly circulate more cheap-to-produce stock repetitions, recycled from backlogs of unpaid artist recordings, loading these de-skilling trances into the places most of us must traverse to eat, socialize and live. <br /><br /> The brutal mass murder taking place in the invasion of Iraq, strategic assassinations, reliance on unpaid domestic labour, the inability to provide the basic necessities of life (healthcare, adequate incomes and housing for all people) and the de-humanizing gestures of those who offer sexual desire, or approval, in return for free music, all these things are direct descendants of a multinational capitalist regime which does not hesitate to manipulate nationalism and national identity for its agenda. The very structures of this regime demand maximum labour while returning minimum, if any, subsistence to its subjects. In many cases it prefers to exterminate those whose labours it is not in a position to benefit from. Though I describe here diverse and unequal forms of violence, varying in intensity, these acts, events, instances are related. Mass death and destruction in Iraq is symptomatic of a regime that values neither life nor labour. <br /><br /> Now is the time to recognize the connection between dissatisfactions, revoltions, and violence, it is not the time to diminish or dismiss any of them. <br /><br />What will characterize the &rsquo;freedom&rsquo; or the &rsquo;not-war&rsquo; beckoned, if the violence and repression that drench those other practices, and form these very concepts, is ignored? <br /><br /> 6 November 2003 (and still relevant)</p>

Years later, thanks to detective work by - naturally - Mr Clint Simonson of the De Stijl imprint, it turned out that not only was Askew still breathing but he had actually recorded a follow-up to his ESP disk in 1970 that had lain in the can for decades. Originally released as a limited vinyl edition by Simonson himself, Little Eyes blew even his revered ESP side to ribbons and stands as one of the most magical outsider/freak artefacts to ever escape the prodigious gravity of the decade in which it was birthed. Askew has a highly idiosyncratic vocal style that is equal parts quizzical bubble-gum chewing kind on shrooms and doe-eyed real people Richard Brautigan character. Perhaps the closest comparison would be to Tom Rapp or Judee Sill’s old buddy Tommy Peltier. His instrumental conceptions certainly owe a massive debt to Dylan circa 64/65 - who the fuck didn’t - especially his spine-tingling harmonica work but it’s the beautiful arc of the songs that will keep you coming back, the way he combines rough, fluffed performances with eye-watering lyrical sentiments, heartbreaking phrasing and weird, clunky chords played on a ‘Martin tiple’. If you ever dug the whole late-60s freak-folk fall-out as documented by Pearls Before Swine, Bleib Alien, Tim Buckley, Fugs, Roots Of Madness et al you are gonna crease. Simply put, one of the most beautifully cracked singer-songwriter albums of a timeless age.

Years later, thanks to detective work by - naturally - Mr Clint Simonson of the De Stijl imprint, it turned out that not only was Askew still breathing but he had actually recorded a follow-up to his ESP disk in 1970 that had lain in the can for decades. Originally released as a limited vinyl edition by Simonson himself, Little Eyes blew even his revered ESP side to ribbons and stands as one of the most magical outsider/freak artefacts to ever escape the prodigious gravity of the decade in which it was birthed. Askew has a highly idiosyncratic vocal style that is equal parts quizzical bubble-gum chewing kind on shrooms and doe-eyed real people Richard Brautigan character. Perhaps the closest comparison would be to Tom Rapp or Judee Sill’s old buddy Tommy Peltier. His instrumental conceptions certainly owe a massive debt to Dylan circa 64/65 - who the fuck didn’t - especially his spine-tingling harmonica work but it’s the beautiful arc of the songs that will keep you coming back, the way he combines rough, fluffed performances with eye-watering lyrical sentiments, heartbreaking phrasing and weird, clunky chords played on a ‘Martin tiple’.

639,0,2008-11-26 02:13:20,2009-01-13 00:00:00,,0,182,"<p>Rarebit is the culmination of a four-year project by sound artists and instrument inventors Steve Barsotti and Eric Leonardson. Taking their cues from 20th Century sound artist-inventors Luigi Russolo and Harry Partch, the self-built instruments of Barsotti and Leonardson use coil springs, eyebolts, various pieces of wood and other familiar materials that are amplified by contact microphones, skillfully producing sounds of incredible depth and texture, an amazing richness and variety given their humble origins. Their unique sounds are unlike any made with traditional Western instruments and modern electronic instruments. Given these novel sounds, their music retains human-level gestures as one expects from traditional acoustic music, yet with an emphasis on texture and timbre instead of melody or meter.<br /><br />Rarebit may draw comparisons to the sounds and music of fellow instrument inventors Hal Rammel, Bob Rutman, and the late Hugh Davies. Most of the nine pieces on the CD (nine tracks, 72 minutes total) are improvised pieces and two were composed. They create streams of sound that move fluidly from scene to scene with a communicative style and a dramatic sense of presence and dynamic range: from effervescent burbling, animal-like whines and grunts, to gritty metallic drones that transform into forlorn hissing and ethereal soundscapes. Some passages are nearly silent, breathy, and tranquil.

Now her third ‘official’ full length on Type Records is about to hit the streets – charmingly entitled ‘Dragging A Dead Deer Up A Hill’ .<br /> She has been involved in collaborative releases contributing a track to Xiu Xiu’s ‘Remixed &amp; Covered’ and four tracks to a split release with Inca Ore, but it is her solitary work which is the most transfixing.

Like their previous output on the Amish label, this ones a melange of tribal thump, eastern drone, raga concrete and melodious melancholia. Hall of Fames unique, not easily identifiable sound has been compared to revered oufits such as Flies Inside the Sun and The Shadow Ring, sometimes even in English. If, like the young scribes from Hayfever magazine, your recollection and your record collection go back further than a time we like to call “the early 90s,” its okay to shout “king me!” and move on. But if you really wanna sit around the ol checkerboard discussing strategy, then your next stop is a Lower East Side of the late 60s; Hall of Fames healthy smattering of influences stretches back to Ludlow Street-era Velvet Underground, Prestige-era Moondog, The Godz and Angus MacLise. Recently the band played a series of shows with The Red Krayola, impressing the hell out of that old Quixotic Dadaist Mayo Thompson and his erstwhile Sancho Panza, David Grubbs. Senor Grubbs was so impressed that he enlisted HoFs Dan Brown to do some drumming for his forthcoming release of covers from various performances from the King Biscuit Flower Hour.

However, the spindly beauty of this recent Oregon transplant's guitar work outshines any morose adjectives that you can throw at it. Understated, yet fascinating and intricate guitar lines are backed by a hushed coo and are at various times augmented with a lush harmonium drone, percussion, and effects that seem to stretch each note out to the spirit world.<br /> <br /> This is Ilyas Ahmed's fourth release, and the first to be put out on a label other than his own. Of course, Nemo over at Time-lag HQ knows a good thing when he hears it: ""Century of Moonlight"" is a six-song masterpiece.<br /> <br /> Tracks such as ""Softly, Tomorrow,"" ""Red Spring,"" and ""The Gathering"" serve to draw the listener deep into inner space, while the excellent ""Your One Mind,"" and ""Seen Through"" call forth the spirits of the great steel guitar gods of yore. ""Kabhi ma Boley Ashista"" is a beautiful droning raga that will leave the hair on your neck standing straight up.<br /> <br /> Packaged in a gorgeous burnt-orange tri-folded sleeve, ""Century of Moonlight"" is a magical excursion through the mysterious night. With Ilyas Ahmed as our guide through this strange penumbra, we have nothing to fear. 9/10 (-review by <a href=""http://www.digitalisindustries.com/foxyd/writers.php?which=493"" target=""_blank"">Byron Hayes</a> at <a href=""http://www.digitalisindustries.com/foxyd/reviews.php?which=1707"" target=""_blank"">Digitalis Industries</a>)</p>",2341,en,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International,1966,,1,,[],Softly Tomorrow

<p>The solicitation of gifts is a vulgar thing and one that I refuse to  stoop to.  For that reason I request that my fans  refrain from  sending gifts more than 4 times in each given year.  The size of the  gift certainly is up to you. The only thing I would advise against  is the sending of cash. It's never a good idea to send money through  the mail. Always use checks and / or money orders.  My mailing  address is 15950 Decker Lake Road, Manor, TX. Times of the year  when a gift might be most appropriate are: June 9th (my birthday),  October 31st (Halloween), December 25th (Christmas), and March 20th (the  first day of spring).</p>

<p>The solicitation of gifts is a vulgar thing and one that I refuse to  stoop to.  For that reason I request that my fans  refrain from  sending gifts more than 4 times in each given year.

Always use checks and / or money orders.  My mailing  address is 15950 Decker Lake Road, Manor, TX.
